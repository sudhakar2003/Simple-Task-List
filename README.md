# Simple-Task-List
The project is a Python task management app that allows users to add, remove, list, prioritize, and receive task recommendations based on task descriptions. It uses a simple text-based interface to interact with users. Here's a brief description of each feature:

1. **Add Task**: Users can add a new task by entering a description and selecting a priority level (`high`, `medium`, `low`).
2. **Remove Task**: Users can remove a task by specifying its index in the task list.
3. **List Tasks**: Users can view a list of all tasks along with their descriptions and priority levels.
4. **Prioritize Tasks**: Users can prioritize tasks, which reorders the task list based on priority levels (`high` -> `medium` -> `low`).
5. **Recommend Task**: Users can enter a description and receive a recommendation for a task that matches or contains the entered description.

The app provides a basic functionality for managing tasks and can be expanded with additional features and improvements based on specific requirements.
